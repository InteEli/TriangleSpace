image but I don’t have time to fix that😥😥😥. I tried many things to get it to work but the solution i found was using a div with position relative
that changes position and overflow hidden when cropping while the image inside stays the same size. I have also done some basic styling 🎂🎂😎🎉 but hoping to improve it more
before the next devblog. I am also working on adding on exporting the project. I am using exporting the list with objects added and then
adding them to another project that you can download from github in the near future🎂❤.`,f,s,j="Changes",b,a,H="The following changes and implementations have been made in that version of the project:<br/> <em>Added cropping</em> <br/> <em>Improved Styling</em> <br/> <em>Bug fixes</em> <br/> <em>Started export</em><br/>",g,h,z="Features",C,m,S="✅ Cropping",w,c;return{c(){l=p("h1"),l.textContent=y,x=u(),o=p("p"),o.textContent=I,f=u(),s=p("h2"),s.textContent=j,b=u(),a=p("p"),a.innerHTML=H,g=u(),h=p("h2"),h.textContent=z,C=u(),m=p("p"),m.textContent=S,w=u(),c=p("br")},l(t){l=r(t,"H1",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(l)!=="svelte-s5tmf6"&&(l.textContent=y),x=v(t),o=r(t,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(o)!=="svelte-1v39m4q"&&(o.textContent=I),f=v(t),s=r(t,"H2",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(s)!=="svelte-6y66jh"&&(s.textContent=j),b=v(t),a=r(t,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(a)!=="svelte-s7jpgv"&&(a.innerHTML=H),g=v(t),h=r(t,"H2",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(h)!=="svelte-mhy7zl"&&(h.textContent=z),C=v(t),m=r(t,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(m)!=="svelte-1pw9bd9"&&(m.textContent=S),w=v(t),c=r(t,"BR",{})},m(t,e){i(t,l,e),i(t,x,e),i(t,o,e),i(t,f,e),i(t,s,e),i(t,b,e),i(t,a,e),i(t,g,e),i(t,h,e),i(t,C,e),i(t,m,e),i(t,w,e),i(t,c,e)},p:_,i:_,o:_,d(t){t&&(n(l),n(x),n(o),n(f),n(s),n(b),n(a),n(g),n(h),n(C),n(m),n(w),n(c))}}}const F={title:"version 0.1.2",date:"2025-05-14"},{title:A,date:D}=F;class R extends P{constructor(l){super(),q(this,l,null,B,k,{})}}export{R as default,F as metadata};
